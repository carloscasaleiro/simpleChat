# Simple Chat

The SimpleChatServer listens on a specified port for client connections. Once a client connects, it reads and displays the messages sent by the client. The server stops when the client sends "/quit" or disconnects.

The SimpleChatClient connects to the server using a specified IP address and port. It allows the user to input messages from the console, which are then sent to the server. The client stops when the user inputs "/quit".
